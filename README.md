The **DOCX to LaTeX Converter API** is a professional-grade service that transforms Microsoft Word documents into clean, well-structured LaTeX projects in just a few steps. Under the hood, it uses advanced parsing algorithms to:

* **Preserve formatting:** All headings, fonts, lists, tables and line breaks are faithfully retained.
* **Handle media seamlessly:** Embedded images and other media are automatically extracted and linked in the output.
* **Generate structure:** A complete Table of Contents is built from your documentâ€™s heading hierarchy.
* **Ensure compatibility:** The resulting files are Overleaf-ready and organized into a ZIP archive containing the main `.tex` file alongside a media directory.
* **Integrate easily:** A simple RESTful API lets you plug conversion into any workflow, and free hosting on Hugging Face Spaces means you can deploy instantly without infrastructure setup.
